## Introduction

The Recipe Hub is a personalized recipe management system that allows users to register, create profiles, 
and discover recipes based on their dietary preferences, allergies, ingredient availability, and cooking 
habits. Users can search recipes by cuisine, meal type, or cooking time, and leave ratings and reviews on 
recipes theyâ€™ve tried. 
Originally built using Spring Boot and MySQL for the backend, the application uses HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript for the frontend. Recipe data is fetched from a structured database with optional support for 
external APIs. Performance is enhanced with basic caching techniques, and the entire system is designed

## Running the Project Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the Recipe Hub on your local machine.

### Step 1: Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* **Java JDK 17 or above**
* **Spring Boot Install**
* **MySQL server running** (with a database created for the project)
* **Code editor** (e.g., VS Code)
* **Postman** (for API testing)

### Step 2: Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

1.  **Create Database:**
    Open MySQL and create a database for the project.

2.  **Update `application.properties`:**
    Configure your database connection details in `src/main/resources/application.properties` within the backend project.

3.  **Run the Application:**
    Open the backend project in your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code with Java extensions) and run the application.
    You can typically do this from your terminal within the backend project directory using:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    

4.  **Access Backend:**
    The backend APIs will be accessible at: `http://localhost:8080/`

### Step 3: Frontend Setup (HTML/CSS/JS)

1.  **Open the Frontend Folder in VS Code:**
    Navigate to the folder where your `index.html` file is located within VS Code.

2.  **Install Live Server Extension:**
    * Go to the **Extensions** tab in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X).
    * Search for "Live Server" and click **Install**.

3.  **Run the Frontend Locally:**
    * Right-click on `index.html` in your VS Code explorer.
    * Select "Open with Live Server".
    * The site will open in your default browser (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5500`).

### Step 4: Frontend-Backend Connection

Ensure your frontend API calls are directed to the correct backend endpoint. The frontend is configured to point to:
`http://localhost:8080/api/recipes`


## Testing the Application

* Test user registration, recipe submission, search, and reviews directly from the frontend user interface.
* Use Postman or your browser's developer tools to thoroughly test individual backend API endpoints and verify request/response cycles.

## Conclusion

The Recipe Hub is a complete recipe management system that demonstrates the seamless integration of a responsive frontend with a powerful Spring Boot backend and a MySQL database. It empowers users to register, personalize their experience, search for recipes, and contribute their own, making it a dynamic and user-centric platform for culinary enthusiasts.
